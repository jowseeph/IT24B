            <h1>Welcome to My About Me Page</h1>
               <h2>Hello! I’m james Lane, a 28-year-old freelance graphic artist thriving in the lively atmosphere of Portland, Oregon. My creative spirit is fueled by coffee and inspiration, and you’ll often find me sketching in charming cafés or immersing myself in the local art community. My designs feature vibrant colors and playful elements, drawing influence from nature and nostalgic cartoons.
                
                    When I’m not creating, I enjoy hiking and spending weekends outdoors, capturing stunning landscapes with my camera. I have a passion for unique thrift finds, always on the lookout for one-of-a-kind pieces to transform.
                
                    Storytelling is at the heart of my work, whether through my art or the podcasts I host, where I explore design trends and chat with fellow creatives. I aspire to motivate others to express their uniqueness and pursue their passions—after all, life is too vibrant for ordinary designs!
                
                    I’d love to connect and collaborate on something extraordinary!
